# Function, nested loops

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studie s** at **ALX Scool**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops andnested loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C filles are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Filles
All of the following filles are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-putchar.c` | prints `putchar` |
| `1-alphabet.c` | prints the alphabet in lowercase |
| `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` | prints 10 times the alphabet in lowercase |
| `3-islower.c` | checks for lowercase character |
| `4-isalpha.c` | checks for alphabetic character |
| `5-sign.c` | prints the sign of a number |
| `6-abs.c` | computes the absolute value of an integer |
| `7-print_last_digit.c` | prints the last digit of a number |
| `8-24_hours.c` | prints every minute of the day |
| `9-times_table.c` | prints the 9 times table, starting with 0 |
| `10-add.c` | adds two integers and returns the result |
| `11-print_to_98.c` | prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98` |
| `100-times_table.c` | prints the `n` times table, starting with 0 |
